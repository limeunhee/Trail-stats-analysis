# Alltrails Recommender
Hiking is a good way to exercise and spend time with friends and family, while also enjoying the surrounding nature. There are a few existing applications and websites that provide information about various hiking trails in the US. When hikers search for new trails to hike on, these websites can be valuable resources with centralized information. While there is a wealth of information on these websites, it is still up to the users to look through various trails and make decision on which one to take on next.   

The goal of this project is to:  
1. Understand influential variables and relationships that affect trail rating  
2. Build a trail recommender that takes userâ€™s favorite trail as an input and recommend top 5 trails that are similar to the user input
